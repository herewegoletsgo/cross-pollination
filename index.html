            <h2>🌱 Ideas are cheap, but alignment makes them powerful.</h2>
            <p>Technology makes it easier than ever to create. What matters now is alignment — with yourself, with others, and with the planet's life-giving systems.</p>
            <p>This platform connects bold, world-changing ideas with the capital and teams needed to make them real. From regenerative bots to modular eco-trains that power themselves and support ecosystems, we help high-impact ideas take root by unlocking capital at key milestones and drawing in aligned talent.</p>
